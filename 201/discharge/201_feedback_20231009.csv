201;201;21.08.2023 09:47;0;In the beginning I had the stronger emotions, as I was nervous about how the glasses would be perceived by people, and also excited to be participating in an experiment. both anxiety and excitement wore down during the week as I got used to the glasses. finally, towards the end of the experimental week, I was looking forward to the end, as keeping track of the wear lot/current conditions/other responsibilities was somewhat frustrating.;1. I do not normally wear glasses, so getting adjusted to the glasses was difficult. Especially due to the bulky frame and the light sensor, the light glasses were a bit painful to wear. I noticed that towards the end of the experiment, I subconsciously fiddled with the glasses more and more, and resting them on my head. I tried to limit how much I did this, but it's an automatic reaction when something is uncomfortable. I believe the light glasses would benefit from being lighter, and perhaps having some padding for resting on the nose.    2. you can see the frame in your field of vision, which is distracting for someone who is not used to wearing glasses.;N/A;1. I spent slightly less time at work than usual, as I found it harder to concentrate due to the light glasses  2. I was more conscious of my habits due to recording my hourly light exposure, exercise, etc. As a result I took more regular breaks from screens.;Friends and colleagues were naturally curious, but most found it funny/enterntaining, and the experience was mostly positive.    However, regularly in public places I would notice that people were glancing at me because of the glasses, which made me feel self conscious. one time I was even approached by someone who was concerned about the glasses.    I would say that the glasses somewhat affected almost all social interactions I had during the week, although most interactions were positive.  ;See my comment in question 3 about the weight of the glasses.    I also believe that there is a bias in the data collected by the glasses - most of my time spent outside is during exercise (e.g. running, swimming during the experiment week), however these are activities for which I had to take the glasses off.    while I understand the technical challenges, I believe that the light glasses would be a more pleasant experience if the light sensor was smaller and lighter, both for comfort and social reasons.    the app could also use some bug fixing. A couple of times in the wear log, it was stuck on asking me to record the time, without letting me record a new event;2
