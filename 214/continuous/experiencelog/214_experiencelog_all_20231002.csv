During this walking in the forest, one question came up to my mind, I also wonder that why you need the glasses for handling this tool? I mean if it's nothing related to glasses it would be much easier to put only in forehead like headlamps which use for hiking at night.;1;1;0;0;0;0;;0;1;0;0;0;Same;29.09.2023 09:15;29.09.2023 09:25
