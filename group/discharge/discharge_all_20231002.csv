I do not normally wear glasses, so getting adjusted to the glasses was difficult. Especially due to the bulky frame and the light sensor, the light glasses were a bit painful to wear. I noticed that towards the end of the experiment, I subconsciously fiddled with the glasses more and more, and resting them on my head. I tried to limit how much I did this, but it's an automatic reaction when something is uncomfortable. I believe the light glasses would benefit from being lighter, and perhaps having some padding for resting on the nose.    2. you can see the frame in your field of vision, which is distracting for someone who is not used to wearing glasses.;N/A;1. I spent slightly less time at work than usual, as I found it harder to concentrate due to the light glasses  2. I was more conscious of my habits due to recording my hourly light exposure, exercise, etc. As a result I took more regular breaks from screens.;Friends and colleagues were naturally curious, but most found it funny/enterntaining, and the experience was mostly positive.    However, regularly in public places I would notice that people were glancing at me because of the glasses, which made me feel self conscious. one time I was even approached by someone who was concerned about the glasses.    I would say that the glasses somewhat affected almost all social interactions I had during the week, although most interactions were positive.  ;See my comment in question 3 about the weight of the glasses.    I also believe that there is a bias in the data collected by the glasses - most of my time spent outside is during exercise (e.g. running, swimming during the experiment week), however these are activities for which I had to take the glasses off.    while I understand the technical challenges, I believe that the light glasses would be a more pleasant experience if the light sensor was smaller and lighter, both for comfort and social reasons.    the app could also use some bug fixing. A couple of times in the wear log, it was stuck on asking me to record the time, without letting me record a new event;2

When I'm outside everyone look at me. Sometimes I'm afraid that someone think I, the foreigner, was monitoring their life and then punch me. ;It always slip on my nose because of the weight of the light device are much more than glasses legs. Also the glasses is not clear even though I wipe it with cloth you offered. I feel very uncomfortable when I wear it: can't see my screen clearly and have to adjust the place of glasses on my nose every 15 seconds (roughly estimated). So inconvenient and I can't focus on my work. I have no idea to cope with it, except using my fingers to keep it in a fixed place. ;When I'm working and looking at the monitor. I have to adjust it very very often and I can't see the screen clearly. ;Keep my fingers on it, if I'm at home I tide the thread behind my head. ;My colleagues and neighbor asked me what's that. Also my roommate feels so uncomfortable when I wear this glasses and have meal with her. She said she felt like being monitored. ;No eyeglasses only glasses frame. It will be much better for me to see things clear. ;2

To the Point where I saw no reason to log them anymore, as I frankly didn't have that much time to spend.;I'm not a technician, but if there is a way to make it look less like a camera, that would bei super helpful and circumvent a lot of awkward interactions.;2

On the weekend It was quite Hot and It felt a little uncomfortable when my skin was sweating.  The rest of the time It was ok.;I was surprised that nobody reacted annoyed.  When I had to look at something like small letters especially when It was a little darker but not dark enough to switch on the light, I would raise the glasses for a couple of seconds and look directly.;When outside;Not at all, when somebody asked about the glasses or looked confused, I justo explained I was participating in this study and It was ok.;A couple of times, but much less than I had expected. At Legoland some.thought It was a camera but even if It has been they did not seem to be angry or worried about It.;Instead of glasses maybe It would be posible to put the device on some kind of hairclip.;2

I just stop thinking about my glass when I talk with other people.;Yes, e.g. Talking with my colleagues, eating with my friends.;I think wearing light glasses will have a greater impact on people who have never worn glasses before than on people who have worn glasses before.  Because light glasses block vision and light receivers make the frames heavy and put pressure on the nose.  So it takes a long time to adapt.  Easily distracts users' energy and attention before adapting.    Is it possible to consider designing a head device? For example, headband  ;2
