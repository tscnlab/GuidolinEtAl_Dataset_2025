On the weekend It was quite Hot and It felt a little uncomfortable when my skin was sweating.  The rest of the time It was ok.;I was surprised that nobody reacted annoyed.  When I had to look at something like small letters especially when It was a little darker but not dark enough to switch on the light, I would raise the glasses for a couple of seconds and look directly.;When outside;Not at all, when somebody asked about the glasses or looked confused, I justo explained I was participating in this study and It was ok.;A couple of times, but much less than I had expected. At Legoland some.thought It was a camera but even if It has been they did not seem to be angry or worried about It.;Instead of glasses maybe It would be posible to put the device on some kind of hairclip.;2
