14;215;09.10.2023 09:56;0;It was sometimes a bit uncomfortable because people ask a lot of questions, but most of the week I was reading literature in a lab so there was enough time to escape it as well.;One of the discomforts I was experiencing is that is was hard to lay down with the glasses on and sometimes I experienced that I felt like my vision was worse with the glasses on (mainly because I'm used to it getting better if I put on glasses and this was not happening.) The glasses were also quite heavy on my nose sometimes ;There were some social events to meet the people of the new class and I noticed avoiding them partially because of the glasses and not wanting this to be the first conversation topic. Furthermore because I couldn't wear sunglasses, I think I went relatively less outside (even though this was not a conscious decision);I sometimes avoided social gatherings and going to public places/outside.;Yes. I think every time I saw someone new who knew me well enough to be comfortable to ask about it, they asked me about it.;I guess the sensor can not be smaller but maybe giving it a more equal design in which the sensor does not primarily press on the nose but use the ears as a pillar more (as with normal glasses). This is hard to achieve of course;2
