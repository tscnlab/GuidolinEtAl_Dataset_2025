The device is little bit heavy causing the eyeglasses to slip forward causing an uncomfortable feeling and equally the temple tip puts some pressure on the ear causing me to have headache sometimes. 2. It equally makes me feel like a miner which is funny sometimes but definitely the design have to be reviewed. I guess, if by any means you can incorporate all the device into a chip and place it around the bridge, it will be fantastic though it will need lots of money and design experience. Overall, I like the experience because it teaches me how to be ponctual and manage time. best of luck ;already commented ;0;0;0;0;0;0;;0;0;0;0;0;it won't ;27.10.2023 08:56;27.10.2023 09:09
