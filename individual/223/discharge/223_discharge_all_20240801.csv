";"Sometimes my nose was hurting so I had to take it off. ";"When I was in the public transport, which I have to use everyday to go to school, I realized most of the people were looking at me, at light glasses. And I think most of them thought it was a camera since they seemed nervous about it. ";"During first two-three days, I had to try to remember the daily activity logs by using my alarms. However, after that I didn't need the alarms for most of the time since I adapted to that schedule. Also, at first I was trying to avoid to be in public or in public transport since I was nervous about the glasses. However, after a while it became something funny for me to see people's reaction and I was more comfortable. ";"In some of my classes, I and other friends who had the light glasses made our lecturers a bit nervous and they had to ask whether it is a camera. I felt sorry about that and wanted to tell the other professors beforehand.  Most of my classmates were curious about it and we had to explain them. Sometimes we told them it is a camera and we are recording them as a joke. Thus, it was funny way to meet and talk to other people for some cases. People in public transport were usually nervous and looking at me curiously. ";"I think if the light sensor can be made smaller and built in in the glasses, it would be much easier to use it. ";2
