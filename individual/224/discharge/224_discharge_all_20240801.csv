It was an interesting experience to notice people are looking at me a fair amount, or in any case more than they usually do. I felt more aware of my light diet, for sure. ";"They were a bit heavy for me sometimes (left red marks on my nose), but that's not a big issue.  Sometimes I did notice that I wanted to take them off if I wanted to focus on something, I'd say mostly in darker environments. I think they did ever so slightly darken my vision even though they weren't coloured lenses.";"When my girlfriend was with me I was a bit more aware of how I looked silly, or it was sometimes awkward to be more intimate while wearing them.";"Sometimes I really got in ""the role""  of a person who wears glasses. When I was focused and studying, for example, if I didn't understand something, I'd frown, take the glasses off, clean them, then put them back on, same way I see people with prescription glasses do it. Small things like taking an umbrella with me when I normally don't, most of the time. Wearing my headphones less often (since the arms of the glasses will hurt me behind the ears). ";"Several people asked me about the glasses. Even a couple of professors. Many people were curious, but I didn't get any negative feedback,only curiosity.";"For me it's obvious that the more compact and light the sensor, the better. Or perhaps some softer material on the nose Bridge? At least for me, since my nose really got red after even an hour of wearing them. Possibly a thinner skeleton? I sometimes was aware I have glasses on me and because I was seeing their skeleton, I pushed them as far up my nose as possible, so that I get them as far from the center of vision as I can, more towards the edge. Maybe a thinner skeleton would have been nice for me";2
