";"I would say I tried to avoid situations where I would need to remove the glasses for a long time as I was worried I would forget something in the procedure in taking everything off and putting it back on.";"I usually run to catch trains/busses etc. but I was worried about the glasses falling (even with the lanyard) that I did move slower during the week.";"I got many questions from my colleagues the first day of lectures when I had the glasses. They were curious about the study after I explained it to them their reactions seemed positive. My children and husband were also very curious about my new ""spy"" glasses and thought they were cool. The teachers at my daughter's kindergarten were worried I was recording, but had a neutral reaction after I explained.";"Overall I think the glasses were fairly light and made to be as unobtrusive as they could in someone's daily routine. I did. have trouble with the glasses fogging during exercise or coming indoors from outside which I did have to remove them briefly to see. So if there was ever a surplus of money maybe an anti fog coating on the lenses would be beneficial. ";2
