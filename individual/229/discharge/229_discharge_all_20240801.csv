I worked normally and sometimes forgot that I wear the glasses anyhow. Sometimes I had to take it off though because my nose and ears got a little sore from the glasses. But that was alright for a week.";"I didn't make any uncomfortable experiences, except that some people were looking at me twice sometimes. However, I asked myself if people thought that I was filming because the sensor resembles a GoPro, and they might feel uncomfortable with that (although it's not true of course).";"In the Lab and at home where colleagues and flatmates asked me what this is about etc.";"I think I might have evaded making eye contact with people sometimes when I was on the road. But I think I do not make eye contact with people excessively when I'm not wearing special glasses. However, I think I might did not want to be confronted with strangers because of the glasses. It was different with people I know though.";"Yes, in the Lab and at home. Frequent questions were ""What is this?"", ""How long do you have to wear this?"" and ""Will you receive money for this?""";"If possible, it would be more comfortable if the sensor would be smaller for both visibility and weight. Also, the glasses are not customized to fit one's nose and eras, which makes wearing uncomfortable sometimes. But I know that producing individual glasses would maybe be too costly in terms of time and money.";2
